Nexus Ultra is a high-performance, minimalist mouse remapping engine designed specifically for gaming mice that lack proprietary software. Built with raw Win32 C++ for zero-latency performance and an ultra-light memory footprint.

## 🚀 Features

- **Zero-Latency Remapping**: Direct Raw Input processing for instant button response.
- **Advanced Macro Engine**: Capture and playback complex key sequences with millisecond precision.
- **Ultra Light Service**: Uses less than 8MB of RAM—lighter than any standard gaming driver.
- **Native Windows Integration**: Built-in "Launch on Startup" and system tray operation.
- **App Launcher**: Map buttons to launch any application or script via a native file picker.
- **Cyberpunk UI**: Modern, glassmorphic interface for configuration.
